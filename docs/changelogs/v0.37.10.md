## Features and Improvements

* **[virtual-machine] Improve check for resizing job**: Improved storage resize logic to only expand persistent volume claims when storage is being increased, preventing unintended storage reduction operations. Added validation to accurately compare current and desired storage sizes before triggering resize operations ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #1688, #1702).

## Fixes

* **[dashboard] Fix CustomFormsOverride schema to nest properties under spec.properties**: Fixed the logic for generating CustomFormsOverride schema to properly nest properties under `spec.properties` instead of directly under `properties`, ensuring correct form schema generation in the dashboard ([**@kvaps**](https://github.com/kvaps) in #1692, #1699).

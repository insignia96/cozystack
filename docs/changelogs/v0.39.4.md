## Features and Improvements

* **[paas-full] Add multus dependencies similar to other CNIs**: Added Multus as a dependency in the paas-full package, consistent with how other CNIs are included. This ensures proper dependency management and simplifies the installation process for environments using Multus networking ([**@nbykov0**](https://github.com/nbykov0) in #1835).

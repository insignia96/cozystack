## Improvements

* **[multus] Remove memory limit**: Removed memory limit for Multus daemonset due to unpredictable memory consumption spikes during startup after node reboots (reported up to 3Gi). This temporary change prevents out-of-memory issues while the root cause is addressed in future releases ([**@nbykov0**](https://github.com/nbykov0) in #1834).

## Features and Improvements

* **[monitoring] Add SLACK_SEVERITY_FILTER field and VMAgent for tenant monitoring**: Introduced the SLACK_SEVERITY_FILTER environment variable in the Alerta deployment to enable filtering of alert severities for Slack notifications based on the disabledSeverity configuration. Additionally, added a VMAgent resource template for scraping metrics within tenant namespaces, improving monitoring granularity and control. This enhancement allows administrators to configure which alert severities are sent to Slack and enables tenant-specific metrics collection for better observability ([**@IvanHunters**](https://github.com/IvanHunters) in #1712).

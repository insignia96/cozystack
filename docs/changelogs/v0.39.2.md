## Features and Improvements

* **[vm] Always expose VMs with a service**: Virtual machines are now always exposed with at least a ClusterIP service, ensuring they have in-cluster DNS names and can be accessed from other pods even without public IP addresses ([**@lllamnyp**](https://github.com/lllamnyp) in #1738, #1751).
* **[tenant] Allow egress to parent ingress pods**: Updated tenant network policies to allow egress traffic to parent cluster ingress pods, enabling proper communication patterns between tenant namespaces and parent cluster ingress controllers ([**@lexfrei**](https://github.com/lexfrei) in #1765, #1776).
* **[system] Add resource requests and limits to etcd-defrag**: Added resource requests and limits to etcd-defrag job to ensure proper resource allocation and prevent resource contention during etcd maintenance operations ([**@matthieu-robin**](https://github.com/matthieu-robin) in #1785, #1786).
* **[tenant] Run cleanup job from system namespace**: Moved tenant cleanup job to run from system namespace, improving security and resource isolation for tenant cleanup operations ([**@lllamnyp**](https://github.com/lllamnyp) in #1774, #1777).

## Fixes

* **[kubevirt-operator] Fix typo in VMNotRunningFor10Minutes alert**: Fixed typo in VM alert name, ensuring proper alert triggering and monitoring for virtual machines that are not running for extended periods ([**@lexfrei**](https://github.com/lexfrei) in #1770, #1775).
